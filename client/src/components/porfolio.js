          "ChemDye" born with the idea to help researchers to achieve their
          goals using the powerful tool of visual communication. As a scientist
          myself, I understood that time and resources are essential in
          research, letâ€™s not waste it. I will put all my knowledge in chemistry
          and biology to create the right image of your investigation in a short
          time frame.
