            <p> "ChemDye" born with the idea to help researchers to achieve their goals using the powerful tool of visual communication.
                As a scientist myself, I understood that, in research, time and resources are essential, letâ€™s not waste it. I will put all my knowledge in chemistry and biology to create the right image of your research in a short time frame.</p>


            <p> I have a BScH degree in Chemistry, a PhD in Neuroscience, and I am a Research Associate at the UniSA (Adelaide-Australia). Art in all their expressions has been part of my life since I can remember, music, painting, illustrations. When I started my PhD, I discovered the art behind the science, each scientific image was an opportunity to be creative, to express myself and to communicate science graphically. I started to teach myself different ways of illustrating, and I never stopped.</p>
